## 1. Overview 

 Clever Birds a project developed as an integration for a game via API along with Flask webserver. The player navigates the avatar bird through obstacles without hitting them, earning points as he or she passes each pipe. The application has a chatbot named “Tweety”, who guides parents about how to use their children's game time as an educational experience. 


<br>  
## 2. Requirements 

 
## 2.1. Functional Requirements

* a1) Fun: Clever Birds is fun and simple. According to Rosewater (2011), the real way to determine if a game is fun is to ask the players if they would play again. We will do this through our chatbot Tweety in a customer satisfaction survey. 
* a2) User Profile: Users can create a user profile.
* a3)  Suitable for kids 5-8 years old: Clever Birds is very simple. After signing in, the user can see a green button on the top right ("PLAY NOW!") on all screens. By pressing the button, the user starts playing.  
* a4) Unique selling point: A chatbot to talk to parents about the skills their children can gain.  
* a5) Player persona: The application allows users to choose between three avatars.
* a6) Cancelation of subscription:  On the page "Manage Account", users can delete their account, which will erase their data from our database. 
* a7) Safety: The chatbot "Tweety" teaches parents how to protect their children by discussing video games' health problems and how to solve them.


## 2.2. Non-functional Requirements

> :small_orange_diamond: Design based on a microservice architecture, using MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.  

* b1) The UI should be usable with 1 hand: In the Clever Birds game, the player pilots the bird into the pipes, by clicking with the mouse.
* b2) Data must be stored in the most efficient way: Our application stores data efficiently, as explained in Appendix X: “Database Design”. 
* b3) Data must be able to be searched and managed as efficiently as possible: In our application data can be managed efficiently, as explained in Appendix X: “Database Design.

## 2.3. High priority requirements

From the agreed ten requirements received, we have chosen five as high priority due to their importance to the overall product functionality and design:

* a2) 	User profiles play a vital role in user experience as it provides a collection of information associated with users. 
* a3) 	The game should be easy to understand and the user’s path to playing the game very simple. 
* a5) One of the key features of what sets Clever Birds aside from Flappy Birds, is the ability for a user to choose an avatar. 
* a6) In order to comply with the GDPR, we allow users to delete their account at any time and their data will be deleted from our database.
* a7) Another key feature setting the application apart from Flappy Birds is a safety feature informing parents about health problems related to video games. 

## 3. How to use our platform

Here is a summary showing how to use our platform step-by-step:
 
>  * STEP 1 - USER NAVIGATION: Users can navigate the platform and use the chatbot "Tweety", even if they are not registered. 
>  * STEP 2 - REGISTRATION: For user registration there are four parameters: first name, username, email and password.  
>  * STEP 3 - LOGIN: For user login there are two parameters: username and password.  
>  * STEP 4 - GDPR: Registered users are able to see his or her stored personal details and delete it from our database (for GDPR compliance)  
>  * STEP 5 - TWEETY: Registered and Unregistered users are able to talk to our chatbot "Tweety".  
>  * STEP 5 - GAME: Registered users are able to play Clever Birds.  

## 4. Clever Birds Game

## 5. Project Architecture 

This project uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture framework, which can be described as an architectural pattern that separates an application
into three main logical components: model (data), view (user interface), and controller (processes that handle input). Here is our architeture:

* Model => The type of data we are using in the application: user's data 
* View => Our interfaces (Html/CSS/Javascript)  
* Controller => In the file with x controllers:  

> :radio_button: We have eight routes, with the following features: 
> * :arrow_forward: 1 - user registration (users can registrate by providing name, username, email and password) 
> * :arrow_forward: 2 - user login (users can registrate by providing username and password) 
> * :arrow_forward: 3 - game (users can play Clever Birds) 
> * :arrow_forward: 4 - change avatar (will allow users to change the avatar)
> * :arrow_forward: 5 - manage account (will allow users to see in their profile their information and allow them to delete their account and data from our database)
> * :arrow_forward: 6 - talk to tweety (will allow users to speak to our chatbot "Tweety")
> * :arrow_forward: 7 - about (will inform how to use the platform) 
> * :arrow_forward: 8 - privacy policy (will inform users of the personal data we collect when they access/use the Website and how we protect their personal data)
